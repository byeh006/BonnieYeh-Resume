        <p class="lead mb-4">I attended Sierra Vista High School when I was a freshman. I was very involved in my school and community during high school. I played tennis since my freshman year and badminton in my sophomore year. I was placed in varsity for both sports in my junior year. I received a few trophies for doing well in my league.  I was in a key club, a community service club that provides service hours and makes new friends. I gained many friends from this club as well as service hours. While becoming active, I was able to run for the board. I became a spirit leader for 2 years and an event task coordinator. As a spirit leader, I was able to help my members in my club perform cheers for a big event in Six Flags to raise money for kids in need. Soon, I became an event task coordinator and I was responsible for finding events for my club in order to gain service hours. <br><br>

        I began gaining my work experience through the midterm elections poll working. My school was giving out flyers to juniors interested in poll working and gain experience through it. I attended a training session where I was taught what to do during the elections, the roles for each person when working, and how to get ready. The process of training was long but I understood what to do during the time of the event. I was responsible for putting in the ballots for the voters. While my coworkers were on their break, I helped their job by assisting voters if they were having trouble and signing them in when registering. I was able to gain experience in customer service that even though there are some people who give an attitude or not listening, I still remained patient and helped them along the way. <br><br>

        Later I was able to get another seasonal job through a mutual friend. I worked as a cater. My job was to prepare meals and serve to the guests. When arriving at my location, my coworkers and I would help the chef unload his trunk with ingredients and materials needed for todayâ€™s meals. Soon we start preparing food like cutting vegetables and seasoning foods. Later we would start preparing the main dishes and start setting tables outside for the guests. We start serving the guests in a buffet style and after everyone leaves, we clean up and start packing up and leave. I learned how to cook and what to do and not do during the process. <br><br>
        
        The summer before my first year in college, I was able to get my first job at a poke store. My job was the prepare ingredients and to make bowls for the customers. I would come in early to prepare the ingredients. Some are already premade like canned corn while some need to be made like cutting avocados. After preparing the ingredients, I would set them out and wait for customers to come and make the bowls. When there is no one there, I would go wash dishes or clean the store. I learned more about customer service and to treat everyone nicely even though some gave an attitude.         </p>
